No worries this is a known case. The reason was that the clock of the bootloader was too fast and some screens couldn't follow and showed scrambled information. The way to fix it is to update the bootloader but that's not something an end user can do. However it doesn't need to be fixed and It won't affect any usages of the VNA. Is there a Battery level indication? (YES for the latest firmware - v1.1.0) Battery level indication is now(firmware version 1.0.2 and previous) presented by voltage figures - lower than 3.4v to recharge is recommended, and lower than 3.2v devices will auto be turned off. This can be later changed to percentage in a later firmware upgrade. How do you set the time from the front panel? RTC time needs to be set from the command line - there are instructions in the manual. What are the differences from the early version(f v2)? 1.Scanning speed increased by 4 times to 400 points/s ; 2.Scanning points up to 501, which will present more details of the measurement; 3.Up to 13 calibration state storage slots; 4.Snp files are named with RTC time, which is easy for viewing; 5.More powerful processor makes the operation smoother and facilitates subsequent firmware upgrades to add more new features.","title":"JNCRADIO VNA 3G"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#tutorials","text":"GENERAL INTRODUCTION IN ENGLISH BY @MLS ANTENNA SETUP(SWR&SMITH CHART) CABLE LOSS MEASUREMENT IN ENGLISH BY @CHELEGANCE FIRMWARE UPGRADE","title":"TUTORIALS"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#resources","text":"","title":"RESOURCES"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#user-manual","text":"JNCRADIO VNA 3G User Manual_V1.0","title":"USER MANUAL"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#firmware-updates","text":"v1.1.0_LATEST - RELEASED 2022.8.19 1.
