Battery level indication is now(firmware version 1.0.2 and previous) presented by voltage figures - lower than 3.4v to recharge is recommended, and lower than 3.2v devices will auto be turned off. This can be later changed to percentage in a later firmware upgrade. How do you set the time from the front panel? RTC time needs to be set from the command line - there are instructions in the manual. What are the differences from the early version(f v2)? 1.Scanning speed increased by 4 times to 400 points/s ; 2.Scanning points up to 501, which will present more details of the measurement; 3.Up to 13 calibration state storage slots; 4.Snp files are named with RTC time, which is easy for viewing; 5.More powerful processor makes the operation smoother and facilitates subsequent firmware upgrades to add more new features.","title":"JNCRADIO VNA 3G"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#tutorials","text":"GENERAL INTRODUCTION IN ENGLISH BY @MLS CABLE LOSS MEASUREMENT IN ENGLISH BY @CHELEGANCE","title":"TUTORIALS"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#resources","text":"","title":"RESOURCES"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#firmware-updates","text":"v1.0.2_LATEST \u2013 RELEASED 2022.1.25 1.COMPATIBLE WITH NANOVNA-SAVER-0.3.10, CAN BE RECOGNIZED AS \u2018JNCRADIO\u2019. 2.FIXED KNOWN TYPOS. v1.0.0","title":"FIRMWARE UPDATES"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#desktop-software-packages","text":"0.3.10_LATEST \u2013 RELEASED 2022.1.25 1.SWEEP POINTS CAN BE SET UP TO 501 POINTS(101,201 IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS) 2.COMPATIBLE WITH JNCRADIO-VNA-3G 0.3.8","title":"DESKTOP SOFTWARE PACKAGES"},{"location":"METER/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#qa","text":"Is there a Battery level indication?
