Battery level indication is now(firmware version 1.0.2 and previous) presented by voltage figures - lower than 3.4v to recharge is recommended, and lower than 3.2v devices will auto be turned off. This can be later changed to percentage in a later firmware upgrade. How do you set the time from the front panel? RTC time needs to be set from the command line - there are instructions in the manual. What are the differences from the early version(f v2)? 1.Scanning speed increased by 4 times to 400 points/s ; 2.Scanning points up to 501, which will present more details of the measurement; 3.Up to 13 calibration state storage slots; 4.Snp files are named with RTC time, which is easy for viewing; 5.More powerful processor makes the operation smoother and facilitates subsequent firmware upgrades to add more new features.","title":"JNCRADIO VNA 3G"},{"location":"JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#jncradio-vna-3g","text":"","title":"JNCRADIO-VNA-3G"},{"location":"JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#tutorials","text":"GENERAL INTRODUCTION IN ENGLISH BY @MLS CABLE LOSS MEASUREMENT IN ENGLISH BY @CHELEGANCE","title":"TUTORIALS"},{"location":"JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#resources","text":"","title":"RESOURCES"},{"location":"JNCRADIO-VNA-3G/#qa","text":"Is there a Battery level indication?
