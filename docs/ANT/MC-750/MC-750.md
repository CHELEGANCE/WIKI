# Q&A
---

* **Can you please tell me what the collapsed length of the telescoping whip is for your antenna model MC-750?**

    The extended length of the whip is 5.2m and the collapsed length around 53cm.

* **Can the spike on the MC-705 be swapped out for another mount, like a tripod or clamp?**

    Yes – The spike and the base(transformer) uses M10 and can be separated.

    You can use something like 3/8 to M10(according to the tripod connector spec) adaptor to make the base able to connect to the tripod.

* **What kind of threads are used to connect the antenna to the base?**

    The base and the black extension tube uses M12, while the other parts uses M10.

    The reason there’s a difference in the design was to prevent users from putting the 7MHz coil directly into the base by mistake, instead of putting it on top of the extension tube.
