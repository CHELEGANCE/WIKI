# Q&A
---

* **I upgraded my SV4401A to firmware V0.3.1, but I found that the UDisk function doesn't work with my Mac.**

    The UDisk function isn't supported for macOS when in upgrade mode. To enter UDisk mode, there are two options: [from the device]either select it from the menu on the main screen or press and hold the Ctrl key while powering on the device to enter upgrade mode.

* **My VNA failed to be switched on while its fully charged?**

    There is a design flaw in the hardware caused this issue however luckily it can be fixed by yourself. Please follow [THIS](notboot-while-fullycharged.pdf) instruction.

* **By mistake i deleted my font file and my VNA couldn't boot, what should i do?**

    You just need to hook up SV4401A to computer(with the USB cable) with U-disk mode enabled, put the copy of the 'Alibaba-PuHuiTi-Medium.ttf' [font file](Alibaba-PuHuiTi-Medium.ttf) back to the system folder in the device. It should be loaded the next time you reboot the device.
