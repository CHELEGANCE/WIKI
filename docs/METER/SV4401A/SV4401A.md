# Q&A

* **My VNA failed to be switched on while its fully charged?**

    There is a design flaw in the hardware caused this issue however luckily it can be fixed by yourself. Please follow [THIS](notboot-while-fullycharged.pdf) instruction.

* **By mistake i deleted my font file and my VNA couldn't boot, what should i do?**

    You just need to hook up SV4401A to computer(with the USB cable) with U-disk mode enabled, put the copy of the 'Alibaba-PuHuiTi-Medium.ttf' [font file](Alibaba-PuHuiTi-Medium.ttf) back to the system folder in the device. It should be loaded the next time you reboot the device.
