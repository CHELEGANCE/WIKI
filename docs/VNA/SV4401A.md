<!--
* I purchased an SV4401A From DX Engineering. Last night while going through the manual and following the procedures, while in the Store/Recall section I deleted the Font File in error. The unit no longer loads and I get an error. I tried doing an update. It was successful, but did not update the Font File. I have a copy of the font file (Alibaba-PuHuiTi-Medium.ttf). How can I get the file back into the SV4401A? Since the unit is only a week or so old, I do not want to get into it before I find out what is involved. Is the memory card soldered in to the board or is it in a socket? Is there a way to load it back in to the unit? Thank You.
