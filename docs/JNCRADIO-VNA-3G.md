## Q&A
* Is there a Battery level indication?

Battery level indication is now(firmware version 1.0.2 and previous) presented by voltage figures - lower than 3.4v to recharge is recommended, and lower than 3.2v devices will auto be turned off. This can be later changed to percentage in a later firmware upgrade.

* How do you set the time from the front panel?

RTC time needs to be set from the command line - there are instructions in the manual.

* What are the differences from the early version(f v2)?

1.Scanning speed increased by 4 times to 400 points/s ;  
2.Scanning points up to 501, which will present more details of the measurement;  
3.Up to 13 calibration state storage slots;  
4.Snp files are named with RTC time, which is easy for viewing;  
5.More powerful processor makes the operation smoother and facilitates subsequent firmware upgrades to add more new features.Â
